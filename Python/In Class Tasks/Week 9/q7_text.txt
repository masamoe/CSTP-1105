CENSORED is a country in North America. 
CENSORED's capital is Ottawa, and its three largest 
metropolitan areas are Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver.
Indigenous peoples have continuously inhabited what is 
now CENSORED for thousands of years.
In 1867, with the union of three British North American 
colonies through Confederation, CENSORED was formed as a 
federal dominion of four provinces.
