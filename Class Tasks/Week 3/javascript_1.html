    	<h1>JavaScript Code 1</h1>
        <p>Use <code>console.log()</code> to output the results of the below questions unless asked to alert them specifically. Feel free to comment out completed questions if the amount of <code>console.logs()</code> takes up too much space in the console window.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Calculate the sum of the following numbers 15, 12, 32, 8, 19, 22, 20 and 7.</li>
            <li>Calculate the average/mean of all the above numbers.</li>

            <br>

            <li>Convert 10 Canadian dollars to USD</li>
            <li>Convert 50 KG to POUNDS.</li>
            <li>Convert 100 POUNDS to KG.</li>
            <li>Convert 2.5 Hours to Seconds.</li>
            <li>Convert 3600 Seconds to Hours.</li>

            <p>For the rest use a prompt to input the value that needs to be converted. Use <code>parseInt()</code> to insure the prompt is converted to a number for your calculations.</p>

            <li>Convert Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius.</li>
            <li>Convert degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit.</li>
            <li>Calculate the year a person was born based on their age.</li>
            <li>--> Extend the above to make it more accurate by checking if the user has had their birthday this year.</li>

            <br>

            <li>Create variables separately for your first and last name and then display them in an alert. Do not use prompts for this.</li>
            <li>--> Extend the above to include a space between them.</li>
            <li>Use three Prompts to ask the user for a type of fruit, the cost of the fruit and the currency to use. Then show an alert that displays "Apples cost in total $5" if that's what was inputted.</li>
            <li>Use four prompts to ask the user what their hobbies are. When that is done display an alert that says "I like the following hobbies: hobby1, hobby2, hobby3 and hobby4.". Make sure to include the commas, the "and" and the period.</li>

            <br>

            <li>Create a system which checks how much annual salary a user makes and then alerts the user whether they are in the low, medium or high tax bracket. The brackets are as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>Low Bracket - Less than 20,000,</li>
                    <li>Medium Bracket - Between 35,000 and 20,000 inclusive</li>
                    <li>High Bracket - Above 35,000</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
             <li>Extend the above to calculate the tax to be deducted from the user's salary and display this info in another alert. The tax rates for each bracket are as follows and need only apply to the user's entire income e.g. high income earners should have 30% tax taken from their entire annual salary:
                <ul>
                    <li>Low Bracket - 10% tax</li>
                    <li>Medium Bracket - 20% tax</li>
                    <li>High Bracket - 30% tax</li>
                </ul>
             </li>
              <li>Further extend the above so that only a single alert is displayed. It should read "You are in the Medium Tax Bracket. Total Tax = tax. Total Net = salary - tax".
             </li>
        </ol>
