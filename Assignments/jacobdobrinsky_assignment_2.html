                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Create an array containing the seven colours of the rainbow.</li>
                    <li>Ask the user using a prompt what their favourite colour is.</li>
                    <li>Check to see if their favourite colour is in the array (casing of letters should not be relevant e.g. "Red" should equate to "red".</li>
                    <li>If their favourite colour happens to be one of the colours in the rainbow array, remove this colour from the array. In a single console.log print out the remaining colours separated by " *** " in reverse alphabetical order (Z -> A).</li>
                    <li>If their favourite colour is not in the array then print out the entire array in a single console.log separated by " xxx " in alphabetical order (A -> Z).</li>

            <li><em>99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall</em>
                <br>
                Starting from 99 and working your way down to 0, print a separate console.log for each number.
                <ul>
                    <li>If the number is divisible by 6, print "smash" instead of the number.</li>
                    <li>If the number is divisible by 4, print "bang" instead of the number.</li>
                    <li>If the number is divisible by both 6 and 4, print "wallop".</li>
                </ul>
                The first ten console.logs should look like<br>
                99 98 97 Wallop 95 94 93 Bang 91 Smash.
                <p>You may want to look up the <em>modulous operator</em> % in JavaScript to help you figure out the divisible part of the code. Saying a number is divisible by 6 means that if I divide that number by 6 I should be left with 0 remainder. Such numbers include 6, 12, 18, 24 etc.</p>
